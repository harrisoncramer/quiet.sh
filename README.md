# ðŸš€ TDD for Typescript/Express API

This is a template for an Express-based API, written in Typescript. We're using ts-jest as the test-runner, and nodemon to watch our files in development.

## Creating Routes

Create new tests inside of the `__tests__` folder first. Start up the test runner with `npm test` and ensure the tests fail. Then, write your routes inside of the source folder until you can get the tests passing. Rinse, repeat.

## Production

The `npm build` script will compile your application into a build folder.
